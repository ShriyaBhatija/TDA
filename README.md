# TDA
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for a classification task on the ISIC 2018 Challenge dataset

## Abstract
This project investigates how well standard tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology and hierarchical clustering, are able to distinguish the different classes of the ISIC 2018 Challenge training dataset. Persistent homology is applied to investigate on the separability of stable rank signatures in terms of various image pre-processing and embedding (2D, 3D, High-dimensional) combinations that were chosen in a pre-selection procedure incorporating average stable rank separation measures. Consistent signatures with lower uncertainty are suspected to be present at least for the high dimensional embedding. Additionally, for suitable combinations, classifiers in the form of SVM are trained in order to investigate if these signatures may serve as an effective basis for classification, in various kernel variations.
